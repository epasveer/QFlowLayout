This is Qt's "flow" layout, as part of their examples.

I'm not sure why this layout is not officially part of the Qt libraries.  My Seergdb debugger
can benifit from this layout in a couple places.  I'm going to use this repo to explore how
to add QFlowLayout to Designer6 as a plugin. Learn something new...
